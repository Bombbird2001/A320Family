# PTU Operation -- conditions --
# if on ground park brake off AND NWS not in 'tow' position, ie off
# if in flight: both masters ON or OFF
# the above AND 500 psi diff between green and yellow
# cargo door operation and YELLOW P/B OFF inhibits PTU operation. PTU op is not allowed for 40 sec after cargo door opr
# inhibited on first engine start attempt
# self test on second start attempt


# RAT --
# powers blue system if no elec or no engines
# deployed if AC BUS 1 and AC BUS 2 are lost
# also deployed manually
# OHP -- on HYD panel powers the HYD 
# OHP -- on EMER ELEC panel powers EMER GEN
# MX retracts it on ground

# Reservoirs --
# pressurized by ENG 1 BLEED
# if no ENG 1 pressurized by XFEED duct
# 2.4 L -- LO LVL (blue)
# 0.5 L -- LO LVL (yellow / green)

# Yellow sys --
# When cargo door open or closed by manual system it turns off the other yellow system except for altn braking and no 2 reverser
# makes an 'OFF' on the OHP yellow pump switch

# Priority Valves --
# Priority valves are there to shut off HYD availability to anything that uses a lot of HYD power if the fluid becomes low
# GRN - NWS, SLTS, FLPS, L/G
# BLU - EMER GEN, SLTS
# YLW - FLPS

# OHP --
# Pump PBs --
# ENG 1 PUMP
#   Green System
#   OFF -- pump depressurizes
#   ON -- pump pressurizes when eng 1 running
#   FAULT -- over heat, lo lvl, lo reservoir pressure (not enough bleed air), or lo pump pressure (inhibited on ground
# BLUE ELEC PUMP
#   Blue System
#   OFF -- no electricity to blue pump
#   AUTO -- pump pressurizes in flight or when one engine is running (or if BLUE PUMP OVRD on MX panel is pushed)
#   FAULT -- over heat, lo lvl, lo reservoir pressure (not enough bleed air),  pump overheat, or lo pump pressure (inhibited on ground
# ENG 2 PUMP
#   Yellow System
#   OFF -- pump depressurizes
#   ON -- pump pressurizes when eng 1 running
#   FAULT -- over heat, lo lvl, lo reservoir pressure (not enough bleed air), or lo pump pressure (inhibited on ground)
# YELLOW ELEC PUMP
#   Yellow System
#   OFF -- pump depressurizes (reverts to this if AC power is lost and restored)
#   ON -- pump pressurizes if AC power avail
#   FAULT -- over heat, lo lvl, lo reservoir pressure (not enough bleed air), pump overheat, or lo pump pressure (inhibited on ground)
#
# PTU PB
#   AUTO -- pump armed, valves open
#   OFF -- valves closes, pump off
#   FAULT -- either green or yellow reservoir LO AIR PR or OVHT or LOW LVL
# RAT MAN ON PB
#   Push: extend manually
#   Guard: must be removed first


# MX PANEL -- AFT OHP
# BLUE PUMP OVRD --
#   ON -- if BLUE ELEC PUMP AUTO turn on BLUE ELEC pump
#   OFF -- turn off blue elec pump
# LEAK MEASUREMENT VALVES --
#   B G Y
#   ON -- normal
#   OFF -- cut off to relevant flight controls in case of leak by closing electrohydrualic valve
